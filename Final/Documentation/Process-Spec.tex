\section{Module 3: Process Scheduling and Context Switching}
\label{Process-Spec}

This section describes how processes are represented, created, and completed within our simulated \texttt{OS}. 

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{PS-m3}

In this module, you will extend the simulator by implementing advanced process scheduling algorithms and context switching mechanisms. The goal is to manage multiple processes efficiently while ensuring fair distribution of CPU time and supporting real-time constraints. This module will prepare the simulator to handle diverse workloads and process types (CPU-bound, I/O-bound, and mixed), laying the foundation for multitasking and system responsiveness.

\subsection{Implementation}
\label{IMP-m3}

This section outlines the our solution to the problem statement. \Cref{PCB} presents out we extended the PCB structure from \Cref{module1}. \Cref{Scheduling} describes out we implemented the seven advanced scheduling algorithms. \Cref{cont-sw} shows how we handle context switching for the preemptive scheduling algorithms. Finally, \Cref{fetNdec} explains how we integrated the fetch-decode-execute cycle with processes and scheduling logic.

} Queue;
